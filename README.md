# short_rna_structure_prediction
A repo for my tiny library I built conducting experiments for Stanford RNA 3D Folding challenge on Kaggle.

`src`: source code of `streamlit` app.

`engine`: source code of the kaggle competition project (with data preparation, training utils etc.)

`Dockerfile`: docker file for huggingface space

As a freezed pretrained model for nucleotide feature extraction I used [`ArmNet`](https://github.com/autosome-ru/ArmNet/).
